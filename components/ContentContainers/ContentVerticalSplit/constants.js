Let’s just say it wasn’t winning any awards, but the feedback, as blunt as it was, honed my skills.",
  "By 17, I jumped into a startup as a QA. But soon, our small ship sailed into the vast ocean of a tech giant. After two years navigating the waters of traditional testing, I craved a setting with fewer ties and spreadsheets.",
  "Taking a brief detour from tech, I eventually found my way back — this time to the agile environment of a budding startup. Merging my self-taught coding skills with a solid QA foundation, automation became my expertise.",
