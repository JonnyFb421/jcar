      "Jonny is a detailed-oriented inquisitive technologist. He looks for the right way to approach a problem, and is open to input and opinions; yet, understands when an approach is simply not working. He communicates well, both at a technical level and personal level.\n" +
      "Jonny was added as a resource to an automated testing tool I was building, and I quickly discovered that I could trust his work and his opinion, and in general enjoyed having him on my team. I cannot stress enough how much better a team operates when people trust each other and enjoy the work being done.",
